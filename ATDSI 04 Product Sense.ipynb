    "<i>Answer:</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a metrics definition question, its important to first explain the business goal of the product or feature and explain the related stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 1: Explain Uber's Motivation for Surge Pricing</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Surge pricing is about fixing imbalances between supply and demand. Such an imbalance could result from either a lack of drivers or an excess number of potential riders. Surge pricing's goals is to increase supply by enticing more drivers to use the application through increased pay, and reduce demand by raising prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 2: Consider Stakeholders Related to Surge Pricing</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mention associated business functions within Uber that could be affected by the surge pricing algorithm not working effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 3: Define Metrics and Counter-Metrics</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Surge specific metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The duration of the surge\n",
    "- The surge pricing multiplier\n",
    "- The number of riders and drivers in affected area\n",
    "- The number of rides taken\n",
    "- The number of rides cancelled\n",
    "- Total revenue for Uber, drivers\n",
    "- Average ride wait time\n",

    "What factors might make the A/B testing metrics on the AirBnB platform difficult?\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Answer:</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Issue #1: Complexity of User Flow</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The booking process is complex; it starts with a search and then requires user-host communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booking flows frequently depend on on factors outside of AirBnB's control, such as host responsiveness to messages left by prospective renters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these issues, we want to make sure we are looking at the correct non-intermediary metrics. For example, there could be a few steps between searching and booking, but the searching to booking conversion rate should be the main metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we want to employ best practices on managing the data generation and collection process. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Issue #2: User Bucketing Due to Multiple People and Devices in Booking Flow</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity arises because planning a vacation often involves multiple people. Even a single person could employ multiple devices, involving multiple and discontinuous uses of the AirBnB platfor (from different IP addresses). If there cannot be a clear one-to-one user-to-device mapping, then the correct user profiles of each would need to be determined during each contact in order to correctly identify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing extra checks with internally and potentially external datasets could help address the device-mapping issue. If there is missing user information (such as if a user deletes their cookies), you can see if you can use other variables to impute the missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Issue #3: Long-Tiume Horizong for Measuring Success</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful consumption of a use of AirBnB's services, such as a happy stay, happens over a longer time horizon than the use of social media. This makes it difficult to accurately measure the influence of various features (through various success metrics which must then be calculated much later). Plus, they are low-frequently events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider measuring longer-term metrics such as user-retention or customer lifetime value. Since A/B tests cannot be run for many months, we need to find shorter-term proxies for such longer-term metrics. A machine learning approach would be to use various features to predict retention or customer lifetime value, and choosing any of the important features correlated with the target metric that can be measured on a shorter-term basis.\n"

    "\n",
    "<u>Step 2: How LinkedIn Can Measure Feed's Engagement</u>\n",

    "A few top-level engagement metrics include daily active users, weekly active users, and monthly active users on Feed. You could also track how many days per week or month users visit, and average user session time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having users long on frequently but not engage does not help LinkedIn's product goal with Feed. To measure depth and quality of engagement, we can track important user actions, such as posts shared, liked, and commented on. You could combine the activity into a single score.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should separately track engagement with ads in Feed. Metrics like impressions and ad-clicks could be bundled under the umbrella of feed engagement.\n",

    "If we give half the users the new features and keep half on the old features, then if the new features help people book more rides, there will be more competition for drivers on the new features, or vice versa if detrimental. Either way, the resulting effect is exaggerated due to these marketplace dynamics. Therefore, our best option is to test by using comparable markets, meaning the metrics in aggregate should be similar across both markets.\n",

    "The 4-step framework for diagnosing metric changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 1: Clarify the Scope of the Metric Change</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is meant by 'active users'? Is this a decrease in daily log-ins, or is it a decrease in usage of a specific feature? Was the decrease in usage abrupt or gradual?\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 2: Hypothesize Contributing Factors</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging Issues: could data pipelines responsible for logging daily active users be broken, making it seem like a genuine drop when it wasn't?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upstream Issues: could there be a problem upstream of daily logins, like a bug in keeping users logged in, or a problem upon opening of the app?\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Step 3: Validate Each Factor</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging Issues: check with the site reliability engineering team, and metrics and logging teams\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upstream Issues: how are login password and recovery issues looking? Or uninstall rate? Anything out of the ordinary?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Changes: how many Snaps were sent and what was the average open rate? Is there a decrease in number of messages sent between users and the number of stories posted and viewed? Have bug reports or app crashes spiked?\n",

    "    <u>Step 4: Classify Each Factor</u>\n",

To go one step further, quantify the direct monetary benefits of the improved search, such as by measuring the evenue generated by purchases of buyable pins that came up as a search result."
