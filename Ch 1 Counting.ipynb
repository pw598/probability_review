    "The seat for the last passenger is either seat $1$ or seat $100$; e.g., seat $42$ cannot be available, because the $42$nd passenger in line would have sat there if possible. Seat $1$ and $100$ are equally likely to be available to the last passenger, since the previous $99$ passengers view these two seats symmetrically. So the probability that the last passenger gets seat $100$ is $1/2$."
